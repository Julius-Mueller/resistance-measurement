# resistance-measurement

This project comprises a suite of python scripts that enable automated
temperature dependent resistance measurement runs using Keithly source and
nanovolt meters as well as a variety of cryo-cooling hardware, all contained in
an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

For details on how to use the software, as well as how to work with and expand
the individual modules, a brief handbook is provided.
